I am Songyang Zhang (<span lang="ch" style="font-family:system-ui;">张宋扬</span> - in Chinese, [Pronounce](https://translate.google.com/?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=%E5%BC%A0%20%E5%AE%8B%E6%89%AC&op=translate)). Currently I'm an applied scientist at AWS AI Labs. I obtain my PhD degree from [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jiebo Luo](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/). Before that, I got my master's degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Jun Xiao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/junx) and my bachelor’s degree from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I've received the [NAACL 2021 Best Long Paper Award](https://2021.naacl.org/blog/best-paper-awards/). My research is on computer vision and natural language processing, especially the intersection between video and language.
