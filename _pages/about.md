I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.rochester.edu/) at [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jiebo Luo](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/). Before that, I got my bachelorâ€™s degree from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) and my master degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Jun Xiao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/junx). I've received the [NAACL 2021 Best Long Paper Award](https://2021.naacl.org/blog/best-paper-awards/). My research is on computer vision and natural language processing, especially the intersection between video and language.
